 * an org id, not every org should be able to see or run every signal;
 * specifically, custom signals and Coop model signals created by one org must
 * not be usable by, or even visible to, other orgs. (This goes beyond whether a
 * beyond whether a visible signal is currently disabled for an org.)
 *
 * To enforce that uniformly, we make the SignalsService take an
 * `SignalReference` for every signal lookup, which includes the orgId! We
 * intentionally do not call this something like `OrgScopedSignalId`, as the
 * `id` field of the returned `Signal` still holds a `SignalId`, and the
 * returned signal still does not contain org-derived properties (like
 * disabled); to do otherwise would be super confusing, as it would introduce
 * multiple forms of signal ids _used publicly outside this service_, given that
 * Conditions already use `SignalId`.
 *
 * NB: below, we treat the case where T = SignalType specially, so that the
 * result type is simpler (but logically equivalent to the result if we didn't
 * apply special casing), which helps TS with inference in many places.
